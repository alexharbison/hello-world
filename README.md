Practice Repository

Hello.

This is the practice repository of R. Alex Harbison, MD MS, head and neck surgeon-scientist. I will be completing my head and neck surgical oncology fellowship at Johns Hopkins University between 2020 and 2023. During this time, I aim to build my skillset in methodologies for interrogating the regulatory role of metabolism on the tumor microenvironment. I aim to use any methodology necessary to interrogate this relationship. With my background in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology, genomics, and head and neck surgical oncology, I aim to lead a scientific team in the pursuit of optimizing response to immunotherapy, mitigating resistance to cisplatin chemoradiation, and harnessing tumor and immune cell metabolism to enhance treatment effect and response durability.
